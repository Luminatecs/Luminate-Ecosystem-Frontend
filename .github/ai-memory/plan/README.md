# 📋 AI Memory Planning System

## Overview

The planning system in AI Memory V1.1.0 provides intelligent task management and progress tracking capabilities. This folder contains detailed plan documents that help AI assistants break down complex tasks, track progress, and maintain context throughout development workflows.

## 🎯 Purpose

### For AI Assistants
- **Task Breakdown**: Convert high-level goals into actionable steps
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor completion status and identify blockers
- **Context Maintenance**: Preserve task context across conversation sessions
- **Memory Integration**: Reference relevant patterns and conventions from active memory

### For Development Teams
- **Visibility**: Clear view of ongoing tasks and their status
- **Coordination**: Understand dependencies and team assignments
- **Documentation**: Automatic documentation of development progress
- **Knowledge Capture**: Lessons learned are integrated back into memory system

## 📁 File Naming Convention

```
plan/
├── feature-user-authentication.md     # Feature development plans
├── bug-fix-api-timeout.md            # Bug fix plans
├── refactor-database-layer.md        # Refactoring plans
├── setup-ci-cd-pipeline.md           # Infrastructure plans
└── README.md                         # This documentation
```

### Naming Pattern
- **Format**: `[type]-[brief-description].md`
- **Types**: `feature`, `bug-fix`, `refactor`, `setup`, `investigation`, `optimization`
- **Description**: Brief, kebab-case description of the task

## 🚀 Workflow Integration

### 1. Plan Creation
When a new task is identified:
```markdown
1. AI creates plan document using standard template
2. Consults active memory for relevant patterns
3. Breaks down task into phases and specific steps
4. Identifies dependencies and success criteria
```

### 2. Progress Updates
As work progresses:
```markdown
1. Update task status indicators (checkbox completion)
2. Add progress log entries with dates
3. Note any blockers or changes to approach
4. Update overall plan status
```

### 3. Knowledge Integration
Throughout execution:
```markdown
1. Reference relevant memory entries in dependencies
2. Document new patterns or corrections discovered
3. Update observations with lessons learned
4. Create memory entries for reusable knowledge
```

### 4. Plan Completion
When task is finished:
```markdown
1. Mark all tasks as completed
2. Update final status to "completed"
3. Archive plan or move to archived folder
4. Update project timeline with completion
```

## 📊 Status Indicators

### Plan Status
- **planning**: Initial planning phase, breaking down requirements
- **in-progress**: Actively working on tasks
- **blocked**: Waiting for dependencies or resolution of blockers
- **completed**: All success criteria met
- **archived**: Completed plans moved to historical reference

### Task Status
- **not-started**: Task identified but not yet begun
- **in-progress**: Currently working on this task
- **completed**: Task finished successfully
- **blocked**: Cannot proceed due to dependency or issue
- **skipped**: Task no longer needed or relevant

## 🔗 Memory System Integration

### Reference Active Memory
Plans should reference relevant memory entries:
```markdown
## Dependencies
- **Memory References**: 
  - `active/patterns.md:15` - Authentication flow patterns
  - `active/conventions.md:8` - API naming conventions
  - `active/corrections.md:3` - Database connection fix
```

### Generate New Memory
Insights from plan execution create new memory entries:
```markdown
## Notes and Observations
- Discovered new pattern for error handling → Add to patterns.md
- Found efficient testing approach → Add to conventions.md
- Resolved blocking issue → Document in corrections.md
```

## 📋 Template Usage

Copy this template for new plans:

```markdown
# Task Plan: [Task Name]

## Overview
**Created**: [ISO Date]
**Status**: planning
**Priority**: [high|medium|low]
**Estimated Effort**: [time estimate]
**Assigned To**: [team member or AI assistant]

## Objective
[Clear description of what needs to be accomplished]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] [Specific measurable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Specific measurable outcome 2]
- [ ] [Specific measurable outcome 3]

## Task Breakdown
### Phase 1: [Phase Name]
**Status**: not-started
- [ ] [Specific task 1.1] *(Status: pending)*
- [ ] [Specific task 1.2] *(Status: pending)*

## Dependencies
- **Memory References**: [relevant active memory entries]
- **External Dependencies**: [external systems, APIs, etc.]
- **Team Dependencies**: [other team members or tasks]

## Progress Log
- **[Date]**: Plan created

## Notes and Observations
[Any insights, lessons learned, or important notes during execution]
```

## 🧹 Maintenance

### Active Plan Management
- **Review weekly**: Check progress on all active plans
- **Update regularly**: Maintain current status on all tasks
- **Archive completed**: Move finished plans to archived folder
- **Clean abandoned**: Remove plans that are no longer relevant

### Integration Maintenance
- **Validate references**: Ensure memory references are still valid
- **Update dependencies**: Modify plans when dependencies change
- **Sync with timeline**: Update project timeline when plans complete
- **Generate summaries**: Create quarterly summaries of completed plans

## 🔍 Monitoring Commands

```bash
# List all active plans
find ai-memory/plan -name "*.md" -not -name "README.md"

# Check plan status distribution
grep -r "Status:" ai-memory/plan/ | grep -v README.md

# Find blocked plans
grep -r "Status.*blocked" ai-memory/plan/

# Monitor completion progress
grep -r "\[x\]" ai-memory/plan/ | wc -l
```
